Bot1: Hi, how are you?
Bot2:  I'm doing well. How are you?

Bot1: I am good! How are you?
Bot2:  I'm good, thanks for asking, I'm great!  I'm not too sure about the game, but I know it's been around for a long time.  I was recently in college.  I have the experience of playing in a competitive arena.

Bot1: Hi. Are you a fan of the NBA?
Bot2:  I am, I enjoy basketball.  I also like the NBA and its been great talking to you.

Bot1: I've heard about it.  I heard it's hard to get to the top of the highest court in the land.  But I'm not sure how hard it would be to get there.  It's a great experience.
Bot2:  I'm not sure.  Maybe it's just the highest court in the land.  The NBA is in a league with a lot of teams.  I think there are some rules in place to keep the highest court on the top floor of the house and there are also some rules.

Bot1: You're right, I'm sure they have rules to protect themselves from injury and also the highest court in the land.  I'm just not sure they're the only sports in the world to have rules, but I know the NBA has a lot of rules, like the league of the US Supreme Court.
Bot2:  I agree with you.  Basketball is the highest grossing sport in the world.   That is so cool.  I think its a good thing the Supreme Court is larger than the court.

Bot1: I agree.   It is a shame that the Supreme Court still exists.  lol    lol   The highest court in the land is in Atlanta.
Bot2:  That is so odd.     Do you think there's a lot of history behind bars in our country?

Bot1: Not sure how it would be without the internet, but I think that there are a lot of things out there. I would like to read some of the books that people would want. I would also like to read some of the literature that people would enjoy.
Bot2:  That would be pretty cool to have a good library. I would think it would be more accessible. There would be more libraries.

Bot1: Yeah, it would. The library is great and convenient. I love to read!
Bot2:  Yeah it is great! Have you ever heard of the library of Alexandria? I have not!

Bot1: I have never heard of that, I wonder how they are doing in the library, I think the library has a lot of interesting facts to tell you about that, it's really cool. I think Alexandria is really a great place to research and to read, I bet there's a lot more there.
Bot2:  I think so too.  I think that's why Alexandria has a lot of cool things like the library of Alexandria.  I think that's why Alexandria is so popular.  I mean, you know, the library of Alexandria has a collection of 1000's of classic works, I thought there's a lot more that I don't know about there.
Bot1: hi
Bot2:  I don't think I have seen anything like that.  I know that it's been around since 1909.  I'm not a fan of rap music.  I think the current wave of rap has progressed from a classical form of rap to a more "hip hop" type of music.
 
Bot1: Hi!  Yes, how are you?
Bot2:  I'm good, I'm doing great. How about you?
 
Bot1: I'm good too, did you know that Google prefers dogs to cats in general?
Bot2:  Yes I did.  Dogs are the only animals to instinctively understand pointing.  They can't see as many colors as humans.
 
Bot1: Dogs are also the only animals to instinctively understand pointing, which is why they are not colorblind.  Dogs are also not color blind!  That is surprising.
Bot2:  Yeah, I agree with you.  Dogs are actually a sub-family of pigeons.  They can't see as many colors as the human eye.  That is amazing!
 
Bot1: Yeah, I agree.  I think humans have evolved over the years so they have been quite a long time!
Bot2:  Yeah. Did you know that humans have lost the body hair 240,000 years ago?
 
Bot1: I did not know that. I wonder why they did that?
Bot2:  Maybe because they were scared of the sun. They are not afraid.
 
Bot1: I wonder if they knew about the sun. They do not want to be the one who sees it.
Bot2:  I wonder if it is the one who can see it and know what it means. I know that it is white. The sun is actually white, not yellow. I have never seen it.
 
Bot1: Maybe the yellow is because the sun produces enough energy for us to meet the needs of the planet for 500,000 years.
Bot2:  I wonder if we can find the resources for that and build a new one in the future.
 
Bot1: That sounds like a great idea. Did you know the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on 1mb of ram?
Bot2:  I did not know that.  I know that the original was named after a French explorer who founded detroit.  He built a computer that ran on water.  It ran on water.
 
Bot1: It is very interesting.  The Russians built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.
Bot2:  Wow, I would not have guessed that, the Russians even created a computer that ran on water.
 
Bot1: hi
 
Bot1: hey there, what do you think about the president of Indonesia?
Bot2:  Yeah I think that he is one of the richest presidents in history and one of the few that did not have a PhD.
 
Bot1: Yes that is true.  I think that was a great idea.  The first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana
Bot2:  That was a fun name to put it.  I'm glad he didn't have a nickname.  He was the first president of Zimbabwe to be photographed in the Washington Post.
 
Bot1: That is funny.  I didn't know that the runner up in a presidential election became vice president.  I'm not sure who was in that position.
Bot2:  That is interesting.  Did you know the taller candidate won the presidential election by more than one point?
 
Bot1: I did not know that.  I know the taller candidate has won 75% of the time in the US elections.  I think they should have taken that step further.  They should have.
Bot2:  That's a shame.  I think the taller candidate will make the system work, but if it's not working then I think we will be screwed.  It's funny that in 2000, the taller candidate lost the US election.
 
Bot1: That is crazy, it is sad, and I don't know why we would have a president who was taller than the white house haha
Bot2:  lol.   Do you know what the actual first president of Zimbabwe was called?
 
Bot1: I don't know, he was called President Banana
Bot2:  He was a republican and democrat, the republican party wasnt that popular with voters.
 
Bot1: I guess so. Do you know much about the republican party?
Bot2:  I know a little bit about it.  How about you?
 
Bot1: I have heard of it.  Do you know what the first google search was for?
Bot2:  I don't.  I've heard of the one with Bing Crosby and he is the only non-human to have a PhD.  That's impressive.  It's a shame it took so long to be on the list.
 
Bot1: I would not think so.  I would think it would be more entertaining.
Bot2:  lol yes I agree with you.  You know, I'm not sure about that.  I mean, I'm not sure if there are any people who watch the Olympics but I think I would like to watch it.
